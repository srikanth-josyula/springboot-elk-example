# Spring Boot ELK Example

This repository contains a simple example demonstrating how to set up logging with Spring Boot applications and integrate them with the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for centralized log management and analysis.

## Overview

The project consists of a Spring Boot application configured to generate logs using the standard logging framework provided by Spring Boot. It includes a logback configuration file (`logback-spring.xml`) for customizing log levels, log file rotation, and log formatting.

The logs generated by the Spring Boot application are then shipped to a central ELK stack using the rsyslog service. Rsyslog is configured to forward logs to a remote Logstash instance, which processes the logs and sends them to Elasticsearch for indexing. Finally, Kibana is used for visualizing and analyzing the log data stored in Elasticsearch.
